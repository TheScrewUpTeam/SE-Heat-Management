# Heat Management Mod for Space Engineers ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

Welcome to the **Heat Management** mod!
Are your batteries too chill? Thrusters running a fever? Vents just blowing hot air?
This mod brings a whole new layer of engineering challenge to your grids: **HEAT!**

---

## What Does This Mod Do?

- **Adds heat simulation** to batteries, thrusters, and vents.
- **Blocks generate, transfer, and lose heat** based on their activity and environment.
- **Overheating batteries?** Watch outâ€”they might just go out with a bang! ðŸ’¥
- **Vents and thrusters** can help cool things down, but you'll need to manage your grid's thermal balance.
- **Neighboring blocks** exchange heat, so your ship's design really matters!
- **Customizable!** All major parameters are configurable per saveâ€”tune it to your liking.

---

## Features

- **Realistic(ish) heat transfer** between blocks and the environment.
- **Visual feedback:** Glowing lights and smoke effects for hot blocks.
- **Per-save config file:** Tweak the mod's behavior for each world.
- **Exploding batteries** if you ignore the laws of thermodynamics.  
- **Fun for engineers, masochists, and anyone who thinks vanilla is too easy.**

## How to Use

1. **Install the mod** like any other Space Engineers mod.
2. **Start a new world or load an existing one.**
3. After first load, a config file (`TSUT_HeatManagement_Config.xml`) will appear in your save's Storage folder.
4. **Edit the config** to tweak heat rates, thresholds, and more. (Save and reload the world to apply changes.)
5. **Build, overclock, and try not to melt your ship!**

## Configuration

See the [Configuration Guide](CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed instructions on all available config variables and how to use them.

- The config file is saved as `TSUT_HeatManagement_Config.xml` in your world's Storage folder.
- You can change heat coefficients, critical temperatures, and more.
- **New:** `LIMIT_TO_PLAYER_GRIDS` (true/false) â€” If true, the mod will only apply heat simulation to grids owned by the local player. The mod will now automatically enable or disable heat management for grids as you take or lose ownership, without requiring a reload.
- The mod will always use the config from your current save, so each world can have its own heat rules.

## Known Issues

- Your ship may unexpectedly become a fireball. This is a feature, not a bug.

## Credits

- Mod by **TSUT** (The Screw-Up Team)
- Inspired by all the engineers who thought "What if batteries could explode?"
